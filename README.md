## W14_Identity

This repository contains a project that demonstrates creating a custom identity system using Entity Framework 
Code First approach.

### User Table Creation

The User table includes two main fields: Email and Password.

### Database Setup with Code First

The database is built using Entity Framework Code First approach.

After defining the User table structure, the database is created, and user records can be added to it.

### Model Validation

Essential model validation attributes are implemented via Identity for the API.

This ensures data integrity and validates user inputs.

### Password Encryption

Passwords are securely hashed during registration.

Encryption methods are implemented to protect sensitive user data.

A custom identity system ensures flexibility and a deeper understanding of the authentication process.
